# Screen Audio Visualizer

Visualize the audio from your screen or browser tab in real time. This app lets you share your screen (with system or tab audio) and displays a frequency spectrum using the Web Audio API.

## Features

- Real-time audio visualization from shared screen or tab
- Screen sharing with system/tab audio (Chromium browsers)
- Customizable spectrum: adjust bar count (up to 256), color scheme, frequency range, smoothing, and linear/logarithmic scale
- Multiple color schemes (rainbow, fire, ocean, green, purple)
- Responsive, normalized bar heights for accurate audio representation
- Built with React, TypeScript, Vite, and Tailwind CSS
